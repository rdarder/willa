## Printable stl files

[Internal parts](internals-rigid.stl). Note that the steering have in-place hinges, so they must be printed in their exact relative positions. Parts don't need support. 


[The top part](top.stl) involves very long bridges, so the interior may have rough layers. It doesn't affect how it looks and adding supports doesn't help much. 


[Tires and bumpers](soft-material.stl) should be printed in TPU or other flexible material. No supports needed.
